A collection of the ciphers I'm learning about during my studies in Information Security at UWS.


Description
===========

Though mostly classical encryption ciphers, hopefully this will be a library of all the ciphers we study in the unit as well as some others that i research out of interest. Feel free to make pull requests with updates and additons to the collection!
